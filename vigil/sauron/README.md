# Sauron

## Abstract 

Automatically identifying vulnerable sections within source code is pivotal for ensuring software security and streamlining developers' debugging endeavors. Traditional static and dynamic methods grapple with scalability issues in the face of such massive codebases. Although machine learning approaches have shown promise in this context, most of them identify vulnerable code at a coarser level, typically the method or file level. This paper introduces Sauron, an innovative ensemble learning method designed for locating vulnerable statements. Our model integrates graph-based and sequence-based neural networks to adeptly capture both local and global contextual cues from program graphs, enabling a more comprehensive comprehension of code semantics and vulnerable patterns.
